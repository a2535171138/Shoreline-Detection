            The <strong>"View Switch" feature</strong> allows you to toggle between different views in the application, providing flexibility in how you analyze and interact with the images and their processed results. Here are some key points about this functionality:
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> The "View Switch" feature is designed to enhance user experience by allowing seamless switching between the view of uploaded images and the processed results. 
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            <strong>How to Use:</strong> To use the "View Switch" feature, simply click on the toggle button. When the toggle is in the "Uploaded Images" position, you will see all the images you have uploaded. When switched to the "Results View" position, you will see the processed shoreline detection results.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            <strong>Visual Indicator:</strong> The toggle switch provides a clear visual indicator of the current view. When switched to the left, it shows the uploaded images, and when switched to the right, it shows the results view.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            <strong>Tooltip:</strong> Hovering over the "View Switch" toggle will display a tooltip that provides a brief description of the feature, ensuring that users are aware of its functionality.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            <strong>Use Cases:</strong> This feature is useful for quickly verifying the upload status of images, reviewing the results without re-uploading images.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            <strong>Efficiency:</strong> The "View Switch" feature helps to improve workflow efficiency by reducing the need to navigate through different sections of the application manually. It allows for quick toggling, saving time and effort.

                The <strong>"Quality Check" feature</strong> helps you ensure that only high-quality images are processed, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the shoreline detection results. Here are some key points about this functionality:
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> The "Quality Check" feature is designed to filter out images that do not meet certain quality standards, such as low-resolution images or images that do not contain shorelines. This helps in maintaining the overall quality of the processed results.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                <strong>How to Use:</strong> To use the "Quality Check" feature, simply toggle the switch. When enabled, the application will automatically screen uploaded images based on predefined quality criteria and exclude those that are deemed unsuitable for processing.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                <strong>Quality Criteria:</strong> The application checks for various factors such as image resolution, clarity, and the presence of shorelines. Images that do not meet these criteria will be flagged and excluded from the processing queue.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                <strong>Visual Indicator:</strong> The toggle switch provides a clear visual indicator of the current state. When switched to the right, the "Quality Check" feature is enabled, and images will be screened. When switched to the left, the feature is disabled, and all images will be processed without screening.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                <strong>Tooltip:</strong> Hovering over the "Quality Check" toggle will display a tooltip that provides a brief description of the feature, ensuring that users are aware of its functionality.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                <strong>Use Cases:</strong> This feature is particularly useful when dealing with large batches of images, as it ensures that the processing resources are focused on images that are most likely to yield accurate results.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                <strong>Efficiency:</strong> The "Quality Check" feature helps to improve workflow efficiency by reducing the need to manually inspect and filter images before processing. It automates the quality assurance process, ensuring consistent and reliable results.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                <strong>Processing Time:</strong> Enabling the "Quality Check" feature will increase the processing time as the application needs to screen and process the images. Please be prepared for longer wait times when this feature is active.
